# broadway-musicals
Analyze data about broadway musicals obtained through web scraping.

## About The Project
My current goal for this project is to get data from broadwayworld.com on all the currently running musicals and put it in a PostgreSQL database. After that, I plan to create some visualizations to track the gross profit of the shows.
Once this is accomplished, I hope to add the ability to update the information.
